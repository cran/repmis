Version 0.2.3

Add `source_data`. `source_GitHubData` turned into a wrapper for `source_data`.

Version 0.2.2

Change how default repo in `LoadandCite` is determined/set.

Version 0.2.1

`LoadandCite` repo option now gets repo information from `.Rprofile`. Thanks to Karthik Ram.

Version 0.2

- Add tools to install old R package versions both in a stand alone function (`InstallOldPackages`) and as part of `LoadandCite`.

- the `package` argument for `LoadandCite` is depricated. Use `pkgs` instead. This is so the syntax matches `install.packages syntax better. 


Version 0.1.1

Documentation and external package load fixes.

Version 0.1

Includes the functions `LoadandCite` for loading and citing R packages as well as `source_GitHubData` for downloading plain-text data from GitHub.
